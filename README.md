# cratercnn-cli

This is a first draft of the code to be released. Currently it only works on OSX because it requires native code. I plan to release a version with OSX and Ubuntu Linux support.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ieee8023/cratercnn-cli
cd cratercnn-cli/
sh compile.sh
sh run.sh data/tile3_24s.png
```
